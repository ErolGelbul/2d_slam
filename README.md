<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
##  1. Introduction

Basic implementation of a 2D SLAM algorithm using Extended Kalman Filter (EKF).
It generates a map of an environment and simultaneously keeps track of the
robot's position. The robot moves randomly and senses the distance and bearing
to the landmarks, which are then used to update the estimated position of both
the robot and the landmarks. The true landmarks are plotted in red, the
estimated landmarks in green, and the robot's path in blue.
